# How to Use

1. Download the desired template file in XML format (e.g. `Zotero.xml`).
2. Launch `Ketarin.exe`.
3. From the menu bar, select `File`, followed by `Import...`.
4. Select the template file and click `Open`.

File names ending in `(Custom).xml` refer to templates that generate a custom installer. This can be used to circumvent the requirement for administrator rights to install the software. The official installers of some apps will not allow installation to proceed without administrator rights. The custom installer will allow you to choose to install the software system-wide (which requires administrator rights) or per-user. Use this template if you want to install the software on a computer where you do not have administrator rights, by installing it into `%LocalAppData%`.
