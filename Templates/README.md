1. Download the desired template file in XML format (e.g. `Zotero.xml`).
2. Launch `Ketarin.exe`.
3. From the menu bar, select `File`, followed by `Import...`.
4. Select the template file and click `Open`.

File names ending in `-unofficial.xml` refer to templates that generate a custom installer. The official installers of some apps will not allow installation to proceed without administrator rights. The custom installer be used to circumvent the requirement for administrator rights by installing the software in a user-writable location, e.g. `%LocalAppData%`.
